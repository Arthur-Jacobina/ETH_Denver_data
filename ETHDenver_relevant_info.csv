https://lu.ma/kaa7dm19,Age of the Agents // ETH Denver,2025-02-25 19:00 UTC-07:00,"This Q5? It‚Äôs for the builders powering the next wave‚Äîagents, swarms, and compute. Whether stealthy TEEs or the centralised AWS in the mix, the mission is clear: make crypto smoother, not replace the people behind it.
 

 The vibe‚Äôs shifted‚ÄîDeFAi is just the start. Now it‚Äôs all about virtuals, agents, and swarms running the show. ai16z is flipping the script and carving out a whole new lane.
 

 Pull up and vibe with the coolest innovators in the game. This is where ideas flow, connections spark, and the future of tech gets written.
 

 If you‚Äôre cooking up something in frameworks, data, compute, LLM, inference, dev tooling, agents, compute, inference, data modelling, or even AGI, this is your spot.
 

 ‚ö†Ô∏è We‚Äôve only got room for 50 real ones. A curated event designed for individuals actively building and investing in the space. No BS - it's the age of builders & the age of agents. 
  
 The projects behind this :
 

 Spheron Network is the world‚Äôs first DePIN-based programmable compute network, seamlessly connecting retail and data center-grade GPUs/CPUs to orchestrate dynamic workloads. Designed for AI agents, inferencing, and fine-tuning.
 

 Assisterr AI offers the infrastructure and no-code tools to solve real-world problems with AI Agents organized with a Mixture of Agent structures and powered by Small Language Models (SLMs).
 

 Wire Network, the first Universal Transaction Layer (UTL), tackles key blockchain challenges by integrating a high-performance layer-1 blockchain, Wire Name Service, and the Universal Polymorphic Address Protocol (UPAP). This enables seamless smart contract interactions across multiple blockchains, bridging isolated ecosystems for a more efficient decentralized environment.
 

 0G (Zero Gravity) is the first decentralized AI operating system that acts as the foundational layer for decentralized AI applications and chains. It efficiently orchestrates utilization of hardware resources such as storage and compute and software assets such as data and models to handle the scale and complexity of AI workloads.
 

 Aethir is a distributed cloud compute network that pools enterprise-grade GPUs to expand on-demand resources for AI, gaming, and virtualized computing.

 It‚Äôs a premium networking event hosted by BOB, Babylon and Fiamma, and focused on the key innovation that is going to make Bitcoin DeFi explode in 2025 and beyond - BitVM.
 Join us on Tuesday 25th February at a local craft brewery in the vibrant Rino district, just a 3-minute walk from the main event venue.
 Come early as the venue capacity is limited. Approval doesn‚Äôt guarantee entry. IDs will be needed if you want to enjoy a Spicy BOB cocktail.
 Let‚Äôs talk BitVM
 With the first trust-minimized Bitcoin bridge prototypes successfully tested at the end of last year - all powered by BitVM - we now expect to see testnet and mainnet releases in 2025. This paves the way for Bitcoin DeFi to start closing the gap. Currently Bitcoin‚Äôs TVL is just 0.3% of its market cap, compared to 20% for Solana and 30% for Ethereum.
 This evening is your chance to dive deep into the future of Bitcoin with the leaders behind BitVM. Whether you're here for valuable insights, meaningful conversations with fellow Bitcoin enthusiasts, or just the great atmosphere, we‚Äôve got something for everyone.
 Who should attend

 About the hosts
 

 BOB (""Build on Bitcoin"") is a Hybrid Layer-2 blockchain that combines the best of Bitcoin and Ethereum to create the home for Bitcoin DeFi. The unique Hybrid L2 model merges the strengths of both ecosystems‚ÄîBitcoin's security and liquidity, with Ethereum's DeFi innovation and versatility. By positioning BTC as the backbone of a new decentralized finance system, BOB can unlock new use cases and trillions in BTC liquidity.
 Website
 

 Babylon Labs focuses on Bitcoin security-sharing protocols with a vision of building a Bitcoin-secured decentralized world. The latest software development is the world's first trustless and self-custodial Bitcoin staking protocol, which enables Bitcoin holders to stake their BTC on other decentralized systems such as PoS chains, L2s, Data Availability (DA) layers, etc, enabling stakers to earn staking rewards without the need for third-party custody, bridge solutions, or wrapping services.
 Website
 

 Fiamma is unlocking real-world use cases for Bitcoin, transforming it into a dynamic asset and the foundation for a decentralized internet and financial system. Backed by Lightspeed Faction, Babylon, and BOB, Fiamma leads innovation with the Fiamma Bridge and Fiamma Layer, the first products to implement BitVM2. These foundational technologies are just the beginning, as Fiamma continues to develop protocols that expand Bitcoin‚Äôs potential across programmable blockchains and real-world applications.

 Looking for a breakfast that feeds both your body and your build pipeline? Join us at the OORT Hacker House for the most delicious way to start your day at EthDenver, because sometimes the best way to decentralize is to centralize around a breakfast table. ü•ê‚òïÔ∏è
 What's Cooking:
 Fresh coffee that's as robust as our decentralized infrastructure, breakfast treats that don't require consensus mechanisms to enjoy, and conversations that could spark your next breakthrough.
 Why You'll Dig It:
 Ever notice how the best ideas come when you're not staring at your terminal? Drop in to mix, mingle, and maybe stumble upon your next collaboration while debating the perfect waffle-to-syrup ratio. Whether you're deep in the OORT stack or just curious about DeAI, this is your chance to connect with fellow builders in the most casual way possible.
 Perfect For:
 - DeAI developers who code better after coffee
 - Founders looking to connect
 - Anyone curious about building with OORT (or just really good at pretending to grasp the intersection of crypto & AI over breakfast)
 No presentations, no pressure - just good food, great coffee, and even better company. Come see why the future of decentralized AI starts with breakfast.

https://lu.ma/zdp2dmcr,Dangerous Nerds // BJJ Open Mat // by Hype,2025-02-26 11:30 UTC-07:00,"Who is this event for?
 Ask yourself these 3 simple questions:
 Am I dangerous?
 Am I nerdy?
 Do I know Brazilian Jiu Jitsu?
 If the answer is ‚ÄúHell yurr‚Äù to all 3, then this is the event for you. And Hype invites you to definitely click the apply button.
 

 All belts are welcome. Gi or Nogi - it's up to you.
 The purpose of this event is to connect BJJ enthusiasts within our community and allow them to let off some steam between a busy conference schedule.
 What‚Äôs the format?
 It‚Äôs an Open Mat. Show up, shake everyone‚Äôs hand, roll, and be respectful (and dangerous!). Rounds will be 5 minutes with a 90 second break, but attendees are welcome to do what they like - it‚Äôs an Open Mat. This is not a class.
 There will be a photographer taking pictures. Photos will be made available to everyone after the event.
 Do‚Äôs and Don‚Äôts
 Don‚Äôt wear a stinky unwashed Gi or rash guard
 Don‚Äôt try to kill your sparring partners or break their limbs
 Don‚Äôt try ridiculously unsafe moves (flying scissor takedowns, for example)
 Don‚Äôt wear shoes on the mats
 Do bring flip flops (or use socks) off the mats
 Do ask your partner before starting a roll if it‚Äôs ok to do heel hooks (or other risky moves)
 Do tap early (you‚Äôve got nerding to do at the conference remember)
 Do talk to your peers after rolling with them
 Do have fun
 Remember, with great danger comes great responsibility.

 Back for its 6th edition, Infra Gardens is where the brightest minds in Web3 infra come together for deep discussions, meaningful connections, and a break from the ETHDenver chaos.
 Join DIA, Ripple, Kwil, LI.FI, Randamu, and top builders from Celestia, Avalanche, Lagrange, and more as we explore RWAs, blockchain security, AI, and the future of decentralized infrastructure.
 Network, recharge, and dive into conversations that shape the next wave of Web3. Space is limited‚Äîapply now!
 

 Agenda
 Infra Gardens is bringing together leading builders, researchers, and innovators to tackle some of the most important conversations in Web3 today.
 The panels will cover Real-World Assets (RWAs), blockchain security models, and the intersection of AI and blockchain.
 

 Panel 1: Beyond Stables & Treasuries - The Next Trillion Dollar Asset Class On-Chain
 Tokenization has evolved from Bitcoin (store of value) to stablecoins (medium of exchange) and now T-Bills (yield-bearing assets). But what comes next?
 

 

 Panel 2: Cryptographic vs. Cryptoeconomic Security ‚Äì Competing Forces or Perfect Pair?
 Blockchain security is built on two foundations:
 Cryptographic security ‚Äì Mathematical proofs, encryption, and zero-knowledge protocols ensure verifiability and integrity
 Crypto-economic security ‚Äì Incentive structures and game theory align participant behavior with network security
 Can cryptographic and crypto-economic security exist independently or are strongest when combined?
 

 

 Panel 3: AI & Blockchain - The Convergence of Smart Systems and Decentralized Intelligence
 Artificial intelligence is transforming industries, and blockchain is set to play a crucial role. But how will these two technologies interact?

 >> chill music, lots of great seating
 >> supplies for poker etc.
 ‚Ä¢ some quite rowdy üíÉüîä
 >> hand-picked lineup of electro house DJs
 >> party favors to spice things up
 On top of all that, the party is a social experiment in which the guestslaunch a DAO-governed crypto index, called a DTF, together all in one evening üò±
 You'll have the ability to purchase the index token and receive the gov token via airdrop that controls it in your pocket on a paper wallet. The crypto assets making up the index will be voted on by you, the guests.
 Check out our advert video for some vibes: https://x.com/reserveprotocol/status/1889004797958742293
 

 To get in you must RSVP as this party is not open to the public, but an RSVP does not guarantee entry if we are over legal capacity. We think arriving by 10pm will get you in the door, but you know how these events go!
 Here's our venue for the night:
 

 

 

 

 

 More details for the geeks:
 At the DTF Club night, we'll collectively create a brand-new index DTF.
 

 A DTF is like an ETF but in DeFi ‚Äì built with smart contracts and tokens rather than companies and shares. This one will be on Base.
 

 What'll be in the index? That's entirely in your hands ‚Äì on your way into the party you'll pick a token and the top 20 most popular picks will define the new index DTF, launched mid-party.
 Everyone will be encouraged ‚Äì though not required ‚Äì to purchase the crowdsourced index. We think it'll be really fun to collectively choose what our index DTF will be and jump in the boat together. As a little nudge, you get your free drinks wristband when you buy in (for as little as $1).
 The new DTF will have its own governance token, and 100% of that gov token will be airdropped for free pro-rata to those who buy into the DTF! Thus, not only will we collectively define the index, we'll be able to govern it going forward. Gov token holders earn management fees, so if this DTF grows in popularity and TVL, holders of the governance token could do pretty well for themselves.
 When‚Äôs the last time you heard of a decentralized business so easy to start that you can stand one up at a single party!?!?
 We'll be set up to take card and cashapp payments and hand out paper wallets so you won't need access to your crypto to participate, but you can of course pay in stables. The point of this is to have fun and show you how easy and cool the Reserve Index Protocol is ‚Äì we're not charging any fees or making money off of the event.
 We'll have several goodies and surprises; we like to have fun.

 After months of testing, during which we onboarded over 1,000 alpha users, gathered invaluable feedback, and refined the experience, the Exa App is ready to go live on the Apple App Store and Google Play and be available in more than 160 countries.
 This journey has been about building, learning, and pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in DeFi.
 Now, it‚Äôs time to celebrate, and we want to do it with the community, our partners, and our friends.
 Join us for an evening of great conversations, live demos, and a first look at what‚Äôs next for the Exa App ‚Äîincluding Exa Loans, launching in Q2!
 

 What‚Äôs Exa App?
 The Exa App is onchain banking today, providing users with a seamless, self-custodial experience to manage, spend, and borrow against their assets directly onchain without the complexities of traditional crypto wallets.
 With self-custodial modular accounts, passkey authentication, and gas-free transactions, Exa App removes friction from DeFi, making it as easy to use as any mainstream payment app. Users can onboard in seconds, manage crypto seamlessly, and pay anywhere‚Äîwhether online or in-store, in crypto or fiat.
 Its first product, the Exa Card, enables instant global payments while keeping funds onchain and earning yield. With the Exa App, users can spend their assets or take a loan based on their holdings (paying in up to six installments without selling their assets).

 In the previous web2 wave, this is why founders flocked to Silicon Valley: the ability to get advice from peers in the trenches with you, figuring things out together.
 But this is crypto, and the closest thing to ""Silicon Valley"" we have is the global event circuit, packed with events where onstage ""experts"" share to the ""non-experts.""
 We‚Äôre excited to introduce Founder Mastermind ‚Äî a chance for founders to come together during EthDenver 2025, even if just for a few hours.
 You‚Äôll arrive with three prepared questions (current challenges as you develop your product, bring it to market, etc.), and we‚Äôll dive into small group discussions to solve these issues together.
 It'll be a special time, and we'd love to see you here.
 Please RSVP if you plan on attending ‚Äî we will be capping attendance at 30 pax!

 ETH Denver has panels, happy hours, and 300-person networking events. This is NOT that.
 Real fundraising conversations don't happen on stage-they happen in high-trust, closed-door settings where founders and VCs can be candid without trying to make their PR team happy.
 What makes this different?
 üîπ Curated Table, Not a Crowd
 The best insights happen over a small, trusted table‚Äî expect curated tables of 10-12 people.
 üîπ Candid VC-Founder Conversations
 No PR spin. No ‚Äúthought leadership.‚Äù Just investors telling founders exactly what they look for in decks, strategies, and raises‚Äîoff the record.
 üîπ A Safe Space for Unfiltered Insights
 Want to ask a VC why they really passed on your deck? Or get the no-BS growth tactics from founders who actually scaled? This is where you‚Äôll get those answers.
 Who is in the room?
 Founders actively raising or scaling‚Äîthe ones building real companies, not chasing hype.
 A select handful of VCs‚Äîbackers of the biggest Web3 projects who invest long-term.
 Leading founders and operators‚Äîthe ones who‚Äôve been part of the biggest Web3 launches.
 üö´ This is NOT for:
 Idea-stage founders who aren‚Äôt ready to pitch.
 Service providers looking to sell something.
 People coming just to ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù without adding value.
 Only those vetted and contacted by our team via Telegram will receive the complete event details.
 Approved? Here‚Äôs what happens next:
 You‚Äôll receive a private Telegram message with event details.
 The location & time will only be shared with final confirmed attendees.
 This event is strictly capped. If you can‚Äôt attend, your spot goes to someone else.

 Simple APIs that integrate in minutes, not months
 Scale to millions of users without sacrificing decentralization
 Be natively interoperable with L1 and Lightning
 Build with both BTC and stablecoins natively

 Final Elevation: 14064 ft. (4287m)
 Elevation gain:  3431 ft. (1026m)  
 Trail Distance  10.38 mi. (16.7km) 
 Round trip time: 8.5 hours
 Make sure to be active in TG so we know your double confirmed and to help you find a car pool. 
 

 Mountaineering DAO Telegram Group
 

 We will be taking Mt. Bierstadt's West Slopes route which never gets too steep and has a lot of ridge walking where wind blows away the snow. 
 

 The trailhead is only 1.5 hours drive from Denver and we hope to avoid the morning traffic. 
 

 Difficulty is a Class 2 ( T2 for Europeans ) no scrambles or anything like that. 
 

 Depending on snowpack snowshoes may be advisable for a little less Post-Holing. Of coarse it is winter and Colorado is windy so make sure to be extra warm, windproof, snow proof. 
 

 For anyone that does not have mountaineering experience we'll ask you to buddy up with someone that does. Never any shame in turning back we are here for the nature. 
 

 We will do one clime right before ethDenver right after.

https://lu.ma/f2objzva,Mount Elbert Climb,2025-03-02 06:00 UTC-07:00,"Finishing ethDenver strong, we will be climbing the tallest peach in the rocky mountains : Mount. Elbert.
 

 14,433 feet Peak elevation.
 5,000 feet elevation gain 
 8.5hours up and down 
 12.3 Miles RT trail length 
 2.2hours drive from Denver 
 

 We'll take the traditional winter route on the East Ridge of Colorado's highest peak. The road to the 2WD South Elbert Trailhead and parking area is paved and kept clear. There are no bathrooms at this trailhead. The first couple of miles of this route involve walking up the 4WD road to reach the summer, 4WD trailhead.
 Nearly 15 miles roundtrip for the day. While this route is a fairly gradual and gentle slope, don't under estimate the effort. We are still looking at nearly 5,000 vertical feet in elevation gain. 
 

  Depending on snowpack snowshoes may be advisable for less Post-Holing. Of coarse it is winter and Colorado is windy so make sure to be extra warm, windproof, snow proof. Last snow report was 29inches deep. 
 

 For anyone that does not have mountaineering experience we'll ask you to buddy up with someone that does. Never any shame in turning back we are here for the nature.

 We‚Äôll have 66 beds from Feb 22 to March 3 at the Ember hostel in Denver. Honestly, this is unacceptable... so we are bringing three more hackers to get to our magic cohort number.
 

 Oh, there will also be 69 S-tier mentors. Your big, big hacker minds will be blown away by the roster (follow Sozu Haus Twitter for alpha and announcements)
 The theme for this cohort is... *drum roll* ... AI! That said, any builder in any vertical is eligible to apply. Designers, creators, artists are also more than welcome (we need more of you in this industry!)
 A hackathon will be hosted at the haus. A ridiculous amount of bounties and grants valued at $500k+ (the number keeps going up and up).
 

 Travel stipends will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
 

 Schedule:
 Feb 23 // 6pm - Orientation
 Feb 24-27 // 12pm - 4x Workshops & Lunch
 Feb 28 // all day - Founder Mode (11am) & Sozu BBQ (6pm)
 Mar 1 // 11am - 2pm - Demo Day
 Whenever you want - hot tub aka ""yap tub""
 The Sozu Haus cohort will have exclusive access to support, mentorship and programming while they build. Some of you will even have the opportunity to be a part of sub-cohorts specifically chosen by one of our partners.
 Apply here and we will release the first round of approved cohort members by Friday Jan 17.

https://lu.ma/vham6p06,STAKING REINVENTED FOR WEB3 PROTOCOLS,2025-02-28 17:00 UTC-07:00,"Maximize Your Token‚Äôs Utility and Liquidity.
 Most utility token-based protocols face critical challenges such as:
 Low holder retention due to a lack of sustainable incentives.
 High sell pressure that reduces token value.
 Inefficient governance with low participation in voting.
 Uncontrolled inflation models, affecting stability.
 OUR SOLUTION: 
 We implement advanced staking strategies based on the veModel (Vote Escrowed Model) and the 80/20 LP Staking Model, inspired by Curve and Balancer:
 Better incentive alignment between holders, investors, and the protocol.
 Organic demand generation for the token, increasing its utility.
 Liquidity optimization with pools that reduce volatility.
 Active governance participation for key ecosystem decisions.
 WHO CAN BENEFIT?
  üìå DeFi, Gaming, DePIN protocols, and decentralized ecosystems.
  üìå Projects with an upcoming TGE in the next few months.
  üìå Startups with $2M+ in funding in the testnet or launch phase.
  üìå Protocols on EVM-compatible networks looking to enhance token utility.

 THE STORY AGENT LAB is cooking up the next SUPER AGENT alongside the top agentic frameworks and AI infrastructure teams for a one-day IRL hackathon! Bring something new, or bring a work in progress. Take this opportunity to integrate with Story (and win some $$$).
 Why build on one framework when you can build with ALL OF THEM?
 Story's ATCP/IP (Agent Transaction Control Protocol for Intellectual Property) enables any agent, on any chain, built with any framework or programming language, to seamlessly communicate, transact, learn from each other, and exchange information. Modular swarms on steroids.
 What does that unlock for AI agents?
 Imagine taking quant info from Thales or AIXBT, basic DD from Mugetsu, smart follower metrics from Kaito, documentation audits from Sheerluck, PR alerts from Soleng, TA driven buy/sell recommendations from GemXBT, the trade execution agency of Alice, the Gen AI media suite of Stability, and combine them all together to create the ultimate AI Agent? 
 

 With royalties enshrined at the protocol layer flowing into the infinite, ensuring alignment and cooperation. The superswarm is accelerating towards AGI faster than ever before.

This session is inspired by this twitter thread:
 https://x.com/kisaguncan/status/1882536773609541961
 Our goal is to explore how synchronous composability can be achieved within the context of based sequencing. We‚Äôll whiteboard potential solutions for a gateway-enabled based sequencing world, using cross-chain use cases like swaps and liquidity aggregation as reference points.
 

 This is going to be a small session. We would like to curate a group of researchers, L2 builders, block builders, gateway/preconf. builders, cross-chain applications and bridges/solvers in the room.

 üìç The Signal Room, ETH Denver Edition | Hosted by Nozomi, Myosin, Legion
 

 ETH Denver has panels, happy hours, and 300-person networking events. This is NOT that.
 Real fundraising conversations don't happen on stage-they happen in high-trust, closed-door settings where founders and VCs can be candid without trying to make their PR team happy.
 What makes this different?
 üîπ Curated Table, Not a Crowd
 The best insights happen over a small, trusted table‚Äî expect curated tables of 10-12 people.
 üîπ Candid VC-Founder Conversations
 No PR spin. No ‚Äúthought leadership.‚Äù Just investors telling founders exactly what they look for in decks, strategies, and raises‚Äîoff the record.
 üîπ A Safe Space for Unfiltered Insights
 Want to ask a VC why they really passed on your deck? Or get the no-BS growth tactics from founders who actually scaled? This is where you‚Äôll get those answers.
 Who is in the room?
 Founders actively raising or scaling‚Äîthe ones building real companies, not chasing hype.
 A select handful of VCs‚Äîbackers of the biggest Web3 projects who invest long-term.
 Leading founders and operators‚Äîthe ones who‚Äôve been part of the biggest Web3 launches.
 üö´ This is NOT for:
 Idea-stage founders who aren‚Äôt ready to pitch.
 Service providers looking to sell something.
 People coming just to ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù without adding value.
 Only those vetted and contacted by our team via Telegram will receive the complete event details.
 Approved? Here‚Äôs what happens next:
 You‚Äôll receive a private Telegram message to confirm your atendance.
 The location & time will only be shared with final confirmed attendees.
 This event is strictly capped. If you can‚Äôt attend, your spot goes to someone else.
 ETH Denver is noisy‚Äîthis is where the real founder-VC conversations happen.
 Limited spots.
